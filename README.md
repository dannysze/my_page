# Personal Page 💁🏻‍♂️

Hello! This is Danny and here is my portfolio website which is built in React.js. I'm interested in front-end development and trying to build my own webpage with different techniques. Currently it is hosted with github pages and would be updated regularly ~~(hopefully)~~ 🤣.

Please visit via https://dannysze.github.io/my_page/ and let me know if you have any questions or suggestions 😉.
