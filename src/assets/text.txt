Hi everyone! I'm 

Danny SZE. 
I believe I can build anything. 

I graduated from The Chinese University of Hong Kong with a bachelor degree Computer Science in July, 2022. Currently, I'm a Software/Application Engineering Analyst at Accenture. 

Hello! My name is Danny and I enjoy creating things on websites and applications. A course of building web applications has kickstarted my interest in web development since 2019. Building (and occassionally designing) interactive applications gives me sense of satisfactory.
